<h1>Project Description:</h1>
This program creates an interactive hangman game centered
around one-word countries. The user gets 6 guesses before
they lose.
<h1>Instructions:</h1>
The user must type in a letter into the console when prompted.
Then they will see the result of their guess in the
console and drawing panel. If incorrect, they begin to fill out
their hangman with limbs. If correct, nothing happens
except for their word becoming more complete. The goal is
to make it to the end of the game without being hanged.
